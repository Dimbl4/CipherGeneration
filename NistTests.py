        The focus of this test is the proportion of zeros and ones for the entire sequence. The purpose of this test is
        to determine whether the number of ones and zeros in a sequence are approximately the same as would be expected
        for a truly random sequence. This test assesses the closeness of the fraction of ones to 1/2, that is the number
        of ones and zeros ina  sequence should be about the same. All subsequent tests depend on this test.

        The focus of this tests if the total number of runs in the sequences, where a run is an uninterrupted sequence
        of identical bits. A run of length k consists of k identical bits and is bounded before and after with a bit of
        the opposite value. The purpose of the runs tests is to determine whether the number of runs of ones and zeros
        of various lengths is as expected for a random sequence. In particular, this tests determines whether the
        oscillation between zeros and ones is either too fast or too slow.
